# This file configures WireGuard for a VPN server that's accessible
# to only one other peer.
#
# The server and client keys can be generated using the following commands
# (although in an untrusted environment, the client should not generate its
# private key on the server):
#
#     umask 077
#     wg genkey > serverprivatekey
#     wg pubkey < serverprivatekey > serverpublickey
#     wg genkey > clientprivatekey
#     wg pubkey < clientprivatekey > clientpublickey
#
# Then, this file should be placed in /etc/wireguard/wg0.conf
# before starting WireGuard:
#
#     wg-quick up wg0
#
# Lastly, IP forwarding must be enabled to forward packets to clients:
#
#     sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
#
# WireGuard should then run as expected.
